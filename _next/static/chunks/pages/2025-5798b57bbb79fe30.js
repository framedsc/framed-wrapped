However,\n    the distribution across the rest of the top ten appears more evenly spread than in previous years,\n    with several games carving out a respectable position in the top ten like Expedition 33, Kingdom Come 2,\n    and even Infinity Nikki, because who doesn’t love playing dress up in our favorite games?\n"],top10hof:["Cyberpunk 2077 continues to hold a firm grip on its lead year over year,\n    once again claiming the top spot in the Hall of FRAMED for 2025 with no signs of slowing down.\n    We do however see a bit of a shakeup with games like Kingdom Come 2 and Expedition 33 charging ahead to dethrone\n    mainstay favorites like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Elden Ring. Perhaps the most notable omission from 2025\n    being the lack of any Baldur’s Gate 3 presence in the Hall of FRAMED top ten.

With June 11th marking our highest single day traffic,\n    the polarizing space adventure took an almost 10% chunk of that for itself, with other popular titles like Ghost of Tsushima,\n    Expedition 33, and Lies of P hot on its heels. Not even the release of Stellar Blade or\n    the Switch 2 days earlier could slow down the passion of our ever wandering members.\n"],busyhof:["June was a busy month for the Hall of FRAMED too, with June 16th seeing the busiest day for entries\n    winning a spot inside the coveted halls of the gallery. Leading the charge on this hectic day was DontNod’s\n    spinoff Lost Records: Bloom and Rage, with a 16% lead over all shots finding a place that day, and leaving\n    Expedition 33 only slightly trailing behind with its 14% share of entries. Perhaps the most notable thing about 2025’s\n    roundup is just how even the spread of the top ten is this year, with an almost even distribution throughout\n    the most popular titles, we may be witnessing a slow dethroning of past year’s frontrunners.\n"]},i=[["142170955630772225",37],["576442964163690527",16],["80738520422944768",77],["770718209913389096",11],["609843077233901599",32],["764427456856981544",15],["349272662901522444",15],["173567676772384768",1],["727947925535195137",2],["128245457141891072",2],["66196453084626944",1],["415478928833118260",1],["188691759470084097",1],["489832819040845824",21],["1056582870958870619",9],["267828878934802453",1],["163919378285461504",4],["660089475678076998",1],["446743605529280522",3],["287893831976747009",9]],s=()=>(0,o.default)(2025,a,i);t.default=s}},function(e){e.O(0,[49,513,774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=74)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
